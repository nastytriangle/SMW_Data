# SMW Data

GUI for what will eventually be a bunch of Super Mario World Data.

Currently includes the interface for Death Counts, functionality to change colors, and USB2Snes connectivity through websocket.
Note: Most hacks use a value of 09 at memory address $71 to trigger a death, but this is not true for all hacks (e.g. Casio uses a value of 06 which will not trigger the counter as written). 

Death Counts inspired by germdove... go check him out at twitch.tv/germdove or tiktok.com/@germdove
