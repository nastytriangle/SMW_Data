# SMW Data

GUI for what will eventually be Super Mario World Data.

Currently includes the interface for Death Counts, functionality to change colors, and USB2Snes connectivity through websocket. Still working on Level Count Reset :-( 

Death Counts inspired by germdove... go check him out at twitch.tv/germdove or tiktok.com/@germdove
